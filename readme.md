# Python Knowledge Requirements for BDA Specialisation

You should have a solid  understanding of basic Python programming and some intermediate knowledge. This includes:

## Basic Python

- Basic Python syntax and data types (`None`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`).
- Understand the concept of variables and variable scope. 
- Control structures (if-else, for and while loops).
- Can write simple functions  and use them in programs.
- Can use basic Python libraries like `math`, `random`, and `date` class in the `datetime` module.
- Handle basic string and list methods for manipulation.
- Can read from and write to files.
- Be able to write simple Python scripts to automate tasks in linux.
- Knows how to handle errors and exceptions using try/except blocks. 


## Intermediate 

- Handle regular expressions for pattern matching in strings.
- Can use advanced Python data structures like sets and frozensets.
- Understand object-oriented programming: classes, objects, methods.
- Can write complex functions and classes with multiple methods and attributes.
- Understand and use list comprehensions and lambda functions.
- Have an understanding of Python's logging system.
- Debugging and profiling Python programs.
- Understand and use context managers for resource management.
- Understand Python's memory management and optimization techniques.
- Understand and use Python's module and package system.

## Libraries

Familiarity with the following Python libraries would be beneficial:

- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

# Linux Knowledge Requirements for BDA Specialisation

You also should be familiar with some basic and advanced Linux terminal commands:

## Basic Linux Terminal Commands

- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `cd`: Change the current directory.
- `pwd`: Print the name of the current directory.
- `cp`: Copy files and directories.
- `mv`: Move or rename files and directories.
- `rm`: Remove files and directories.
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file content.
- `echo`: Display a line of text.
- `head`: Output the first part of files.
- `tail`: Output the last part of files.
- `man`: Display the user manual of a command.
- `exit`: Exit the terminal.

## Advanced Linux Commands

- `grep`: Search for a specific pattern within files.
- `find`: Search for files in a directory hierarchy.
- `chmod`: Change the permissions of files or directories.
- `chown`: Change the owner and group of files or directories.
- `df`: Report file system disk space usage.
- `du`: Estimate file and directory space usage.
- `tar`: Archive files.
- `gzip`: Compress or expand files.
- `ssh`: Secure shell remote login.
- `ps`: Report a snapshot of the current processes.
- `top`: Display Linux tasks.
- `kill`: Send a signal to a process.

You should be able to use these commands comfortably and understand their options and parameters. 
You should also understand the concept of Linux file permissions and know how to use pipes (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`).
